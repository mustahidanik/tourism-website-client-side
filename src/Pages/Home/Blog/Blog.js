                <h3>Which of these travel motivators rings true for you?</h3>
                <p>Why do people leave their homes and voyage all over the globe? The reasons why people love to travel are varied, and very personal.</p>

                <p>One of the reasons why people love to travel: challenging themselves with new places, people, and experiences.</p>

            <div className="w-75 mx-auto text">
                <h3>Challenging yourself.</h3>
                <p>You might feel like you’re stuck in a rut in your daily life. Or you’re yearning for something exciting and different. You’re craving new experiences and new challenges. Travel is the ideal place to test yourself. It pushes people to their limits and gets them outside their comfort zone. You’ll discover how resourceful you are when you’re exposed to new places, people and experiences. Maybe it’s finding your way around a busy city. Or ordering a meal when you don’t speak the language. Or zip-lining. You’ll feel pride when you finish your trip successfully. Overcoming challenges will bring you joy and energy for future tests. You’ll realize how capable you are and build your confidence.</p>

                <h3>Learning.</h3>
                <p>Learning is a strong reason why people love to travel.  They want to experience something unfamiliar and leave with new skills or knowledge. Seeing the world is more educational than a high school or college class. This condensed crash course in discovering how the rest of the world lives actually will cover subjects like history, geography and sociology. Every destination has something unique to teach visitors, and immersing themselves in a completely different world is the best learning experience.

                    People may travel to learn something specific: a new language, a new cuisine, aspects of a different culture, or a deeper appreciation of faith or spirituality. As a bonus, they’ll take away more than their specific goal. They’ll discover totally different ways of doing things. They’ll also gain awareness of new customs, cultures, people and places. And because you’re actually experiencing this learning in real life, not reading it in a textbook, it will stay with you for a long time. You’ll gain a deep sense of satisfaction with the new skills you’ve learned – and new insights you’ve gained.</p>

                <p>By being exposed to new places, people and cultures, you’ll develop a wider world view.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="w-75 mx-auto text">
                <h3>Expanding your perspective.</h3>
                <p>Another reason why people love to travel: it helps open your mind. You realize that there’s no one way to live life. Meeting people from other places will show you that your world view isn’t the same as everyone else’s.

                    You can’t imagine how different life is in another place until you see for yourself. Everything from work to family to beliefs to interests is not what you might expect from your own experience. The different setting will also help you discover and consider fresh ideas you hadn’t thought of before. You’ll come home with different notions and possibilities. By being exposed to new places, people and cultures, you’ll develop a wider world view. And that will make you a better-rounded global citizen. It’s a great reward and big reason why people love to travel.</p>

                <h3>Getting in touch with yourself.</h3>
                <p>Getting away from home gives you the opportunity to reflect on your life. You have the needed time and space to let your mind wander and take stock. Traveling is one of the best ways to learn more about yourself. Every day traveling brings a new set of issues and opportunities. The way you handle those also gives you insight into who you are. You’ll come home knowing yourself better, and with a fresh perspective on what you want out of life. The experience will change your life.</p>
